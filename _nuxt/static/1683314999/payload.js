This solution allows Andrii to move his arm using the muscles of the scapula and preserve the sensitivity of the wrist and elbow joints. To raise funds for the implant, 91,770 hryvnias (∼$2490) needed to be collected, and this amount was fully covered thanks to donations.","We are pleased to announce that the complex operation was successfully performed, and Andrii is now in rehabilitation, actively working on restoring his right arm and shoulder.
