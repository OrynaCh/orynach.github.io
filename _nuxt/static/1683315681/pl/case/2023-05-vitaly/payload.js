He is currently undergoing rehabilitation after an injury he sustained in October. Despite having gone through six surgeries, the fighter is not giving up. Vitaliy works with a rehabilitation specialist almost every day, and can now use three fingers on his hand (previously, he couldn't use his hand at all). Doctors at the military hospital and engineers at 3D Metal Tech developed an implant that replaced the defective part of his elbow bone and will promote his further rehabilitation. Thanks to the donations of caring people, we were able to raise the necessary amount to manufacture this implant - 36,251 hryvnias (991 USD).",image:"2023-05-vitaly.webp"}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0});
