After returning, he continued to work, and in the spring of 2022, he was mobilized again to defend Ukraine. While performing a combat mission in the Kherson region in July 2022, his group came under enemy fire, and Vasyl was injured in his left shin, right thigh, and pelvis. Fortunately, the artery was not affected, and the bleeding was contained. Evacuation from under fire was very difficult. Vasyl and his group were taken out only in the morning.","Currently, the main operation is the restoration of the left shin so that Vasyl can walk again. Although the wounds have already healed, the bones are still shattered. Therefore, volunteers from Materialise, together with doctors from the Volyn Regional Hospital, have developed a special implant for bone restoration. Its cost was 86,478 hryvnias (âˆ¼$2,340).","During the installation of the implant in Vasyl, there were some complications, but now he is gradually recovering after the operation. The soldier is gaining strength and waiting for the bones to fuse. Doctors constantly monitor his condition."],image:"2023-05-vasyl.webp"}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0});
